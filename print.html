	<p>&quot;Pressroom Digest&quot; Magazine </p>

	<p>The Ultimate Relationship Test Brochure</p>
	<p>This cabinet is marketed as a selection of &quot;The Ultimate Relationship Test&quot; series. The finished cabinet is a classic design and the instruction sheet is laid out simply, but there are enough joinery parts in this kit to guarantee an argument or two among the builders. Other pieces in the series are &quot;Bathroom Vanity&quot; and &quot;Flatscreen TV Mount.&quot;</p>
