I have used github for other web classes that I have taken. I am still learning how to effectively use the interface.

I am using this repository for buidling a portfolio site that I started in Dreamweaver. Some edits were made in VSCodel

This website has a home page, print portfolio page, contact page and an about me page.

I created the repository online and added the files locally. I pushed the files to github through the desktop app.
